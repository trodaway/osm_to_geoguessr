# osm_to_geoguessr
Converts nodes from OpenStreetMap's GeoJSON format to GeoGuessr's CSV format. Currently GeoGuessr only supports points (aka nodes).

## Getting data from OSM
Data can be exported from OpenStreetMap at https://overpass-turbo.eu/. When you export your data, simply choose to download in GeoJSON format.

## Importing to GeoGuessr
Within GeoGuessr's Map Maker function, there is an option to "import CSV file" of points - choose this option.
